Analyzing employee data through EDA and correlation analysis to find the factors that attribute to attrition to eventually building a predictive model to identify at-risk employees that can be used for future insights.

## Methods
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Examined numeric variables like age, salary, tenure, and promotion histroy
- Explored categorical variables such as gender, job role, department, business travel, and ethnicity
2. Visualizations
- Boxplots, scatter plots, pairplots, heatmaps, and stacked bar charts were used to pinpoint patterns and correlations
3. Statistical Tests
- Conducted nonparametric tests to determine which variables significantly relate to attrition
- Results showed that variables such as Years at Company, Years in Current Role, Years Since Last Promotion were the most significant
4. Predictive Modeling:
- Built Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to predict attrition
